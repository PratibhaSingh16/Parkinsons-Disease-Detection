# Parkinson's Disease Detection





Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative disorder which leads to a range of motor and cognitive symptoms. 
PD diagnosis is a challenging task since its symptoms are very similar to other diseases such as normal ageing and essential tremor. 
Much research has been applied to diagnosing this disease. This project aims to automate the PD diagnosis process using deep learning, 
Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to differentiate between healthy and PD patients.
